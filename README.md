# UFOs

In this module, We will build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array.

# Overview of Project

We have been tasked with assisting Dana to create a clean and clear webpage to display her data on UFO sightings 
around the world. She wanted her data in a table that could be filtered down to make it easier to use. Using 
JavaScript, we have created a webpage that Dana can use to present her article and her findings.

# Results and Search Process

The way we have set up our webpage allows for a user to first read the article, and then begin their own search. 
This flow allows for Danaâ€™s article to be the focus. Then we move into the filter search boxes. The user can search 
under any of the following fields: Date, City, State, Country, or Shape. Whichever filter is use will pull up a 
table of any matching UFO sightings. Searchers will be able to read all the above listed information as well as the 
duration and comments about the sighting.

# Summary

This design is case sensitive to the data that was provided, which means city names are lowercase. If an uppercase
is use or misspell while written a town name, it will be unable to find the data. We could make edits to have the 
search bar recognize upper and lowercase for the city, state, and country filters. We could also create 
a dropdown menu of options for the shape filter to make it a bit easier since those are descriptive words and people 
may search under one word but our data lists have a different word. If the purpose of collecting this data is to 
study the behaviors and appearances of UFOs, researchers will likely publishing their findings in articles or journals. 
These publications could be collected on the website to give users more insight into UFO sightings.
